Pipes (||) have special meaning both in FitNesse so they may break a query into several columns incorrectly: here is an example:


{{{|SELECT 'a' || @txt as token|}}}

to prevent query from breaking, add !- !- -! and !- -! -! around it - FitNesse will parse it correctly:


{{{|!-SELECT 'a' || @txt as token-!|}}}


here is a test example

!|set parameter|txt|1,2,3,4|

!|Query|!-SELECT 'a' || @txt as token  -!|
|token|
|a1,2,3,4|
