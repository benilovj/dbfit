Pipes (||) have special meaning both in FitNesse and Teradata - so they may break a query into several columns incorrectly: here is an example:

|note|SELECT :txt AS n, :txt || 'ABC' || :txt AS token|

to prevent query from breaking, add !- !- -! and !- -! -! around it - FitNesse will parse it correctly:

|note|!-SELECT :txt AS n, :txt || 'ABC' || :txt AS token-!|

here is a test example

!|set parameter|txt|1|

!|Query|!-SELECT :txt AS n, :txt || 'ABC' || :txt AS token-!|
|n|token|
|1|1ABC1|
